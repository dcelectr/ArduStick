# ArduStick
Arduino compatible board (ATmega 328P) for breadboards or small projects where space is limited.
The J3 through J5 are intended to be populated by a single row 23 pin female socket, but it can be substituted (since the footprint is the same for 0.1" pin spacing) with 90 degree (horizontal) male header if you want to plug the ArduStick directly on a breadboard.
This design has been built and tested. It works!
